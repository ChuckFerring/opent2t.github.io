                Translators

            <dd>
                Repository of translators, grouped by translators written for a specific schema. The translator name is a unique string provided
                by the manufacturer identifying a Thing.

                    <b><i>Next steps:</i></b> We would love to work with the community to add new translators to the initial
                    existing sample schemas, in order to support new Things and additional protocols.</li>

            <dd>
                On PCs/tablets/phones, developers use the console app as a runtime to communicate with and onboard actual Things. The console
                app hosts the node.js process. When a Thing is on boarded, it is recognized by its unique identifier, its
                translator loaded, and the Thing is exposed, through the AllJoyn bus, as an AllJoyn device supporting the
                schema it is translated to.

                    with some bugs with the jxcore hosting in cordova), OS X support (works now in the node cli), finish Android
                    (bridge and sample  done, need help finalizing the console app for Android, including hosting jxcore), iOS support, explore
                    additional ways to host the runtime and to identify/build robust cross-platform libraries for the different
                    protocol buses used to communicate with Things.</li>

            <dd>
                In the cloud, developers use the device schema to communicate to similar Things translated to that schema in a node.js process.
                The alpha version contains JavaScript/Node common code that can work on any cloud environment that supports
                node.js.

                    for Translators running on gateways (e.g. Arduino, home Hubs, others) to gateway-connected Things marshalled
                    from the cloud.

                The alpha version contains sample apps for Windows UWP, Android, JavaScript/Node common cloud code (with Azure IoT Hub and
                AWS Kinesis) and can be used a base for new real apps.

                By adding voice files that can understand a specific schema, developers enable their favorite assistant to control all similar
                things that are translated to that schema. The alpha version contains a few sample Cortana voice files.

    <h2>How to get Involved</h4>
    <p>
        We want to invite developers to check out the alpha, view the vision and code demo videos, read the getting started guide, ask questions,
        and contribute Translators for their favorite hardware to the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participation is welcome! As an alpha project, we are actively developing based on this initial roadmap.
        Keep in mind that this is not ready for production deployment yet.
