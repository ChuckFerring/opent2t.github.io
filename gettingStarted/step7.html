            Finally, since this is just node you can also run this translator in the cloud. Check out our cloud repo where we have common
            code for a cloud-based rule engine that runs these translators. There are also some sample cloud apps that you
            can check out in the cloud repo. For translators that don't have any local dependencies, running in the cloud
            opens up entirely new scenarios, e.g. headless operation based on user behaviors and triggers.
        </p>
        <p>For cloud scenarios there are 3 applications that show how deviceTranslator files can make easier to build cloud
            solutions that needs to handle devices that use different interfaces and protocols.

            </ul>
            <h3>How to run the apps</h3>
            <p>The apps are self-contained node.js app. You can deploy the apps on Azure/AWS (IotHub Sample/AWS Kinesis Sample)
                or any other cloud infrastructure that supports running node.js applications. Once the application is deployed,
                make sure to run 'npm install' in order to download all dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>Please refer to the README.md file for more details on the app structure and configuration files.</p>
            <h3>Azure IoTHub Sample</h3>
            <p>The sampleapps repo contains a sample application that uses Azure IoTHub to connect devices to a node.js app
                that runs a simple rule engine. The sample is designed to show how a 'push' model based on Azure IoTHub can
                leverage openT2T to abstract device specific details and provide a standardized interface that can make writing
                simple automation scripts much simpler. In this case the app shows a simple rule engine that consumes events
                submitted to the IoTHub by different devices. Azure IoTHub is a fully managed solution that is used to managed
                the data ingestion and device management part of the process, while openT2T offers the ability to write code
                that is require to handle every single time of device.

            <p>Please refer to the README.md file in the repo for more details on how to use the app the various configuration
                files.</p>
            <h3>AWS Kinesis Sample</h3>
            <p>
                The sampleapps repo contains a sample app that uses AWS Kinesis to connect devices to a node.js app that runs a simple rule
                engine. The app provides the same functionalities available in the Azure IoTHub Sample, it just uses a different
                'ingestion pipeline (in this case based on AWS Kinesis)'
            </p>
            <p>Please refer to the README.md file in the repo for more details on how to use the app the various configuration
                files.</p>
