            Run the IoT explorer for AllJoyn on a PC, and notice that it starts listening for announcements on the AllJoyn bus. Next,
            run the console project that we cloned earlier, following the build instructions in its README. Make sure you provide API keys
            for the Wink service as specified in the README for the console repo. This is a developer
            focused cross platform cordova app built with the ionic framework and it implements some Wink onboarding UX.
            Let's onboard the Wink Light we just implemented via this app, which does everything we just did in node but
            in addition it will also initialize the OpenT2T bridge with the translator for this device.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After you complete onboarding, you will see the Wink Light we just implemented in the IoT explorer for AllJoyn,
            exposing the standard lamp schema we implemented, and can turn the light on and off from there. Any app developers who
            code to this schema on the AllJoyn bus no longer need to worry about the details of what bulb implementation is hiding behind it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, let's see our translator in action with one of our sample apps instead of IoT explorer for AllJoyn. Clone the sampleapps
            repo, and find the UWP lamp sample. This sample kicks things up a notch by using the voice files that live in
            the voice repo to get some Cortana integration. Neither the code, nor the voice files, are written specifically
            for the GE Link light bulb. They are written to the schema and will work with any bulb that implements it. Try
            using some of the commands in the voice file for light bulbs with this sample running.
