            Let's write a simple test script which will allow us to pass onboarding information in to the translator as we code. We can
            just copy the test.js script from the Test Light translator and modify it to suit our needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The test script just takes the result of onboarding from the command line, builds the device object, and initializes the
            translator. It then calls some of the schema methods implemented by the translator, e.g. on and off. It depends
            on the node module optimist, so let's add that as a dev dependency:
        </p>

        <code>
        $ npm install optimist --save-dev
        </code>

        <p>
            <br/> We need to modify the test script we copied from the Test Light translator to take the two parameters we received
            from Wink Hub onboarding, and pass them to the initDevice method. This will be done by the runtime when this
            translator runs for real. These are the parts you need to modify:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                var argv = require('optimist')
                <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.usage('Usage: $0 -i [device Id] -a [access token]')
                <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.demand(['i'])
                <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.demand(['a'])
                <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.argv;
                <br/>
                <br/> // device object used for testing purposes (this is normally populated by the runtime)
                <br/> function Device(deviceId, accessToken) {
                <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.props = ' { "id": "' + deviceId + '", "access_token": "' + accessToken + '" }';
                <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.name = "Wink Light Bulb (Test)";
                <br/> }
                <br/>
                <br/> var device = new Device(argv.i, argv.a);
                <br/>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            We can now run the test script with the access token and device id we got from onboarding earlier, and see the results printed
            out to the screen:
        </p>
        <code>
            $ node test -i 3559678 -a abcc2f4ds55asd531ec78cc08b236gd 
        </code>
        <p>
            <br/> This should result in console output indicating that the correct data is being passed in to the translator,
            and all the translator methods are being called correctly. Now that we have everything scaffolded out, let's
            write some code to talk to Wink in thingTranslator.js.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is actually the simplest and most fun part. We are just calling a REST API from the node script, and now that we have
            the access token and the device ID for our bulb in the Wink service, we can make some magic REST calls to set
            its power state. You can look at the
            <a href="https://github.com/openT2T/translators/blob/master/org.OpenT2T.Sample.SuperPopular.Lamp/Wink%20Light%20Bulb/js/thingTranslator.js">full implementation</a>            in the translators repo but it is a fun exercise to try and write this yourself, using the Wink API documentation
            as reference.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, when you run the test script, if all goes well, you should actually see your bulb turn on and off per the test sequence
            defined in your test.js script. Voila!
        </p>

        <code>
            $ node test -i 3559678 -a abcc2f4ds55asd531ec78cc08b236gd
